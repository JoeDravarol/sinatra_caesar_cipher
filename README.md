# Caesar Cipher (Sinatra Web App)

Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest encryption techniques.  It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. For more information click [here](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/)

This web app accepts a text input and a shift integer, which ouputs the encrypted message after applying the Caesar cipher.
